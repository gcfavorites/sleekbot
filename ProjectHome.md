Sleekbot is written in Python, using the SleekXMPP library. All features are implemented as plugins (in a similar fashion to SleekXMPP).


Please note that the repository is not currently hosted at Google Code. Feel free to check out the code at: svn://netflint.net/sleekbot.

Currently interesting plugins which are present, or under development include:
  * A 'ping' bot.
  * RSS feed announcements.
  * A '!seen' command for tracking users in a muc.
  * A XEP plugin which allows users to query the XMPP Extension Protocols.
  * An interface allowing the bot to run Eggdrop TCL scripts (allowing access to a large number of existing IRC scripts).
